# The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos

The aim of this work is to perform baryonics mass based abundance matching. This code contains (in no particular order) tools to calculate the projected correlation function from galaxy surveys and compare that to an abundance matched catalog. For observational data we use a matched catalog from ALFALFA and NSA to obtain baryonic mass estimates and DarkSky N-body simulation.
